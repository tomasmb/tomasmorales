## Experience

### **AI Product Engineer (Senior PM / Engineering Lead)**

**2 Hour Learning** — Remote | Feb 2025–Present

- Designed **generative AI pipeline** to create lessons and question banks from a knowledge graph (Math Academy Way), enabling mastery-based learning and spaced repetition. Each atomic skill generates targeted lessons and exercises to close knowledge gaps dynamically.
- Sole technical owner of **Common Core Crawl**, an AI-assisted system that ingests and transforms standardized test data into **QTI 3.0 XML** for large-scale use.
- Built converters to transform PDFs/HTML into QTI, achieving **~100% accuracy** on supported question types.
- Integrated **AI prompting pipelines** for crawling, enrichment, transformation, and validation with Claude & OpenAI.
- Documented **prompt engineering strategies** (“brainlifts”) after extensive experimentation to improve reliability and speed.
- Delivered end-to-end systems: architecture, coding, deployment, and iteration at startup pace.
